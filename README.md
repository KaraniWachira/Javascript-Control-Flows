This repo contains my solutions to the JavaScript assignment questions below.

Question 1: 
Write a JavaScript program to get the current date.
Expected Output :
mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy

Question 2: 
Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 and 10, and the user is then prompted to input a guess number. The program displays a message "Good Work" if the input matches the guess number otherwise "Not matched".

Question 3: 
Write a JavaScript program to find the closest value to 100 from two numerical values.

Question 4: 
Write a function to print numbers from 1 to 100, for multiple of three you should print “Fizz” instead of the integer and similarly print “Buzz” for multiples of 5 and lastly print “FizzBuzz” for multiples of three and five.

Question 5: 
Use any loop statement of your choice to print items from an array of your choice.
